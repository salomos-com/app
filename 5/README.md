Certainly! Below is a Python script that reads a JSON file, extracts the `"content"` field from each object, and writes it to a new Markdown (`.md`) file with the name as the item ID:

```python
```

Replace `'item_id'` and `'content'` with the actual keys in your JSON data. Make sure to adjust the `input_file_path` and `output_directory` variables according to your file paths. This script will create separate Markdown files for each item, named after their item IDs, containing the extracted content. 😊
