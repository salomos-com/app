use speech to text feature to create input text in html field and add
```


## HTML and JavaScript (Front End):
The HTML5 Speech Input Field allows users to input data into a form field through speech. It utilizes the Web Speech API, which converts spoken language into written text.
To add speech input to an HTML input field, simply include the x-webkit-speech attribute in your <input> element:
HTML

<input type="text" x-webkit-speech>

Clicking the “Start Listening” button activates speech recognition.
The recognized speech is displayed in the input field and also shown in the output area.



## Backend

We'll use Flask as the framework and Redis for a hit counter.

Certainly! Translating a natural language sentence into an SQL query involves several steps. While it's challenging to cover all possible variations, I'll provide a simplified example using Python. Keep in mind that real-world implementations may require more sophisticated techniques and libraries.

Let's assume we have a simple use case where the user provides a sentence like: "Show me all customers who made purchases in the last month."

We'll break down the process into the following steps:

### Parse the Natural Language Sentence
- Use a natural language processing (NLP) library (such as spaCy or NLTK) to extract relevant information from the sentence.
- Identify key components like entities (e.g., "customers," "purchases," "last month") and their relationships.

### Map Entities to Database Tables and Columns
- Define a mapping between natural language entities and your database schema.
- For example:
    - "customers" might map to the "Customers" table.
    - "purchases" might map to the "Orders" table.
    - "last month" might map to a date range.

### Execute the Query
- Use a database connector (e.g., `pyodbc`, `psycopg2`, or `mysql-connector-python`) to execute the query against your database.


For more robust solutions, consider using dedicated NLP-to-SQL libraries or services. Some existing tools include:
- [SQL Translator](https://github.com/whoiskatrin/sql-translator)
- [Langchain](https://pythonawesome.com/a-python-framework-to-transform-natural-language-questions-to-queries-in-a-database-query-language/)
- Huggingface Transformers
- Google Cloud Natural Language API

## Dockerfile
Create a file named `Dockerfile`

This Dockerfile tells Docker to:
- Build an image starting with the Python 3.10 image.
- Set the working directory to `/code`.
- Set environment variables used by the `flask` command.
- Install `gcc` and other dependencies.
- Copy `requirements.txt` and install the Python dependencies.
- Add metadata to the image to describe that the container is listening on port 5000.
- Copy the current directory (project files) into the image.
- Set the default command for the container to `flask run --debug`.

Make sure the Dockerfile has no file extension like `.txt`. Some editors may append this extension automatically, which would result in an error when you run the application.

## Docker Compose (compose.yaml)

Create a file named `compose.yaml` (or `docker-compose.yml`) in your project directory and paste the following:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:5000"
  redis:
    image: "redis:alpine"
```


This Compose file defines two services:
- `web`: Uses an image built from the Dockerfile in the current directory. It exposes port 8000 on the host, which maps to port 5000 in the container.
- `redis`: Uses the official Redis image from Docker Hub.

Now you're ready to use Docker Compose to manage your multi-container application! Run `docker-compose up` to start the containers. Access the application on `localhost:8000`.


## Github workflow

Let's set up a GitHub Actions workflow to deploy your application from a GitHub repository.
GitHub Actions allows you to automate tasks, including deployment, directly from your repository.

### Create a Workflow File
- In your GitHub repository, navigate to the root directory.
- Create a new file named `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (you can choose any name, but `deploy.yml` is common).

### Define Your Workflow
- Inside `deploy.yml`, define your workflow using YAML syntax.
- Specify the events that trigger the workflow (e.g., `push` to the `main` branch).
- Define the steps required for deployment (e.g., building, testing, and deploying your application).


### Customize the Workflow
- Replace the placeholder commands (`npm install`, `npm run build`, etc.) with your actual build and deployment steps.
- Adjust the workflow to match your specific project requirements (e.g., deploying to a cloud service, a server, or a static site).


## Check the Workflow
- Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository.
- You'll see your workflow listed there.
- If there are any issues, check the logs for details.
